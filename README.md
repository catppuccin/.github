Organization-wide community health files

<!-- Organizations can add community health files to a specially named `.github` repository to serve as organization-wide defaults for all repositories within their organization. -->

<!-- You can add `CONTRIBUTING`, `SUPPORT`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT`, `ISSUE_TEMPLATE(S)`, or `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE(S)` files to an organization-owned `.github` repository, and if a given community health file doesn’t exist for a repository, the organization-wide default will be used. -->

<!-- While the file itself won’t appear in the file browser or Git history for each repository, it will be surfaced throughout developers’ workflows, such as when opening a new issue or when viewing the Community Profile, just as if it were committed to the repository directly. -->

<!-- For more information, see [creating a default community health file for your organization](https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/creating-a-default-community-health-file). -->

### Reporting A Vulnerability

If you have any reason to believe that there are security vulnerabilities across
any repository in the organisation, please report to
**[core@catppuccin.com](mailto:core@catppuccin.com)**.

We will aim to respond as quickly as possible, but note that the above mailbox
is **not** monitored 24/7. If the report is confirmed to be true, we will make
the necessary changes required to fix the issue. We will deploy a patch as soon
as possible depending on the type of port and complexity of the issue.

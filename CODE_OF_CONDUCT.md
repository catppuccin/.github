# Catppuccin's Community Guidelines

This document defines guidelines for any person(s) participating in the
Catppuccin community, whether they are a contributor, user, or observer. We
want to ensure that everyone feels welcome, safe and included in our community.

The guidelines apply to all "collaboration platforms" used by the Catppuccin
community, which can be defined as any platform where members interact with
each other. This includes, but is not limited to, GitHub, Gitea, Discord and
any other platforms that may be used in the future.

1. **Respect Diverse Perspectives**
    - Participants are expected to be tolerant of opposing views, disagreements
  should be addressed with respect and courtesy.
2. **Civil Communication**
    - Participants should communicate professionally and constructively, focusing
  on the merits of ideas rather than targeting individuals.
3. **Assumption Of Good Intentions**
    - Participants should always assume good intentions. Misunderstandings may
  occur, and it is important to give others the benefit of the doubt before
  jumping to conclusions.
4. **Zero Tolerance Of Harassment**
    - Harassment, including offensive comments, unwanted advances, intimidation,
  or any behavior creating discomfort, will not be tolerated.

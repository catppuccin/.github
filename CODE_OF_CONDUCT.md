### Community Guidelines

This document defines guidelines for any person(s) participating in the
Catppuccin community, whether they are a contributor, user, or observer. We
want to ensure that everyone feels welcome, safe and included in our community.

The guidelines apply to all "collaboration platforms" used by the Catppuccin
community, which can be defined as any platform where members interact with
each other. This includes, but is not limited to, GitHub, Gitea, Discord and
any other platforms that may be used in the future.

1. **Respect for Diverse Perspectives**
   - Participants are expected to be tolerant of opposing views, disagreements
     should be addressed with respect and courtesy.
2. **Civil Communication**
   - Participants should communicate professionally and constructively, focusing
     on the merits of ideas rather than targeting individuals.
3. **Assumption of Good Intentions**
   - Participants should always assume good intentions. Misunderstandings may
     occur, and it is important to give others the benefit of the doubt before
     jumping to conclusions.
4. **Zero Tolerance of Harassment**
   - Harassment, including offensive comments, unwanted advances, intimidation,
     or any behavior creating discomfort, will not be tolerated.
5. **Value of Human Interaction**
   - Show respect by means of thoughtful discussion. Exchange original ideas in
     original words. Use AI only to assist, not to replace entirely.

### Enforcement

Discord is, currently, the only platform that is actively moderated by members
of the Catppuccin leadership team. As we aim to be community-driven, unofficial
communication channels such as (but not limited to) Matrix, IRC, Telegram, etc.
are subject to their respective rules; the Catppuccin leadership team does not
have any sway over moderation decisions taken there.

If a participant is found to have violated the community guidelines, as outlined
above, the Catppuccin leadership team may take any action they deem appropriate,
up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community
without warning. If they are also a maintainer within the Catppuccin GitHub
organization, the leadership team may also revoke their maintainer status, and
stop accepting contributions from them.

Ultimately, the action taken will depend on the severity of the violation, and
if the participant feels that the action taken was unjust, they may appeal to
the leadership team. However, we do not guarantee that appeals will be
successful.
